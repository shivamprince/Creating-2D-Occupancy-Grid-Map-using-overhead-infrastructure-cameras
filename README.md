# Creating-2D-Occupancy-Grid-Map-using-overhead-infrastructure-cameras
Creating a 2D occupancy grid map using overhead infrastructure cameras in a ROS environment involves capturing images from the cameras, processing these images to detect obstacles, and generating the occupancy grid map. This map represents the environment in a 2D grid where each cell indicates whether it is occupied. The process includes setting up the ROS workspace, configuring the cameras, processing the image data using computer vision techniques, and publishing the occupancy grid map. The map is then used in Gazebo for simulation, enabling visualization and interaction within a simulated environment.
